#Erle-brain

Erle-brain is an [open hardware](https://github.com/erlerobot/PXF) and [open source](https://github.com/erlerobot/ardupilot) Linux-based autopilot to make drones. It consists of a BeagleBone Black and a PixHawk Fire Cape and comes with a Debian image flashed, ROS preinstalled and the latest ready to fly code ;).

The **PixHawk Fire Cape (PXF)** is a daugther board for the **BeagleBone Black (BBB)** development board that allows to create a fully functional Linux autopilot for drones. The combination of BBB and PXF allows to have a Linux computer that can create robots.

We ship Erle-brain with the following characteristics:
- Debian Wheezy 7.5
- ROS Hydro Medusa
- APM 3.2-rc14
- 4 GB eMMC and microSD card capable
- Cortex-A8 @ 1 GHz
- 512 MB RAM
- 12 PWM outputs
- RC Input using either PPM-SUM or S.Bus
- 1 USB Host, 1 UART, 3 I2C, Buzzer connector, Failsafe connector.

-------

**The hardware has many more peripherals and we are working hard to bring them out.**

To acquire the board visit [erlerobotics store](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/erle-brain/).

**NOTE**: **The PixHawk Fire Cape is still in development thereby some of the systems included might not have full support at the time of shipment.**

##About
For years we've been working in the robotics field, particularly with drones. We have passed through different Universities and research centers and in all these places we actually found that most of the **drones are black boxes** (check out our [60s pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKAqjyXaC18)). Not meant to be used for learning, research. The software they use is in most of the cases unknown, closed source or *not documented*.
Given these conditions, how are we going to educate the next generations on this technologies? How do you get started programming drones if you don't have $1000+ budget? Which platform allows me to get started with drones without risking a hand?

We are coming up with an answer to all these questions, our technology at [Erle Robotics](http://erlerobotics.com) and our drones brain: [Erle-brain](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/tienda/erle-brain).

Inspired by the BeagleBone development board, we have designed a small computer with about 36+ sensors, plenty of I/O and processing power for real-time analysis. Erle is the enabling technology for the next generation of aerial and terrestrial robots that will be used in cities solving tasks such as surveillance, enviromental monitoring or even providing aid at catastrophes.

Our small-size Linux computer is bringing robotics to the people and businesses.
