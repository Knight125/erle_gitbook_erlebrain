The **PixHawk Fire Cape (PXF)** is a daugther board
for the **BeagleBone Black (BBB)** development board
that allows to create a fully functional Linux autopi-
lot for drones. The combination of BBB and PXF
allows to a Linux computer that flies either through
copters, planes or even building rovers that can nav-
igate around.
