#APM/Ardupilot Autopilot Tutorial

###Introduction

The ArduPilot code base is quite large (about 700k lines for the core ardupilot git tree) and can be quite intimidating to a new user. This page is meant to give some suggestions on how to come up to speed on the code quickly. It assumes you already are familiar with the key concepts of C++ and the many of the examples currently assume you will be exploring the code on a Linux system.

This page and the pages linked below are designed to be used as a tutorial. You should work through each page step by step, trying things for yourself as you go. We will also be adding more pages over time.
If you think some important information is missing or could be improved then please write in Erle Robotics [forum](http://forum.erlerobotics.com/).
