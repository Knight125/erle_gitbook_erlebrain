The PixHwak Fire is a cape designed for the BeagleBone Black that allows to create a fully functional Linux drone. This cape has on its own all the needed sensors, conectors and buses that allows the autopilot's software to execute porperly. Thanks to its connectors, is able to integrate in the autopilot new sensors and hardware. The union of the BeagleBone Black and the PixHawk Fire, makes the Erle-Brain a highly modular and customizable system.

And, of course, this board is also an open-hardware cape. You can check the design [here](https://github.com/diydrones/PXF)
