# ROS packages for Erle Robotics products

In Erle-Robotics we are creating ROS packages to use them in [Erle-Brain](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/erle-brain/) and in our [vehicles](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product-category/vehicles/). You can check them in the webpage of ROS ( within Robots/Hardware --> Robots section). At this moment, we are giving support to two products with their respective packages:

* [Erle-Brain ROS packages](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Erle-brain)

* [Erle-Copter ROS packages](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Erle-copter)

In a near future, we will add new packages and vehicles!
