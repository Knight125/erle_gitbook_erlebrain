>Snappy Ubuntu Core is the new version of Ubuntu that includes transactional updates - a minimal server image with the same libraries as todayâ€™s Ubuntu, but applications are provided through a simpler mechanism. The snappy approach is faster, more reliable, and lets us provide stronger security guarantees for apps and users.

We've [partnered with Canonical](http://www.ubuntu.com/things) to deliver the next generation of robots connected to the internet and having access to automatic security upgrades, applications and developer tools.

### Software architecture

There are four layers that make up a snappy machine: the hardware layer, provided by the device manufacturer or Canonical, the system layer, provided by Canonical, a layer of frameworks that extend the base system produced by vendors in collaboration with Canonical, and a set of snappy applications, provided directly by vendors. Updating any piece just means using the new version of a read-only image, reverting to a previous version is just as easy.
