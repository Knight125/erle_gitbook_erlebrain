This design incorporates a GPS uBlox Neo-7M and the HMC5883L digital compass. [The kit](https://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/erle-gps-erle-ublox-gps-compass-kit/) also includes a molded case and pedestal mount which provides a convenient way of mounting the module high and away from possible sources of interference.

This GPS module significantly outperforms the Mediatek GPS due to the larger antenna and next-gen chipset. An excellent solution for multicopters and rovers in particular, where GPS accuracy is paramount. It features active circuitry for the ceramic patch antenna, rechargeable backup battery for warm starts, and I2C EEPROM for configuration storage.

The module is compatible with APM-based autopilots such as Erle-brain.
